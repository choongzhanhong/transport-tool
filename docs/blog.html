		<h3>some user experience improvements</h3>
		<time datetime="2024-09-12">2024-09-12</time>
		<p>
			As I make my way into making a more usable tool, I will need to
			improve the interface. To start, I had to add more fields into the
			calendar representation. I think this would really help visualise 
			how much one spends on a particular day.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next step is to make the calendar interactable, because I want
			the user to be able to click any day and set it as a starting point,
			allowing them to calculate the fares spent in a 30-day span starting
			from that day.
		</p>
		<p>
			A stretch goal would be to allow the user to plan far ahead. Say,
			they may have more trips planned next month. The calendar is currently
			limited to display up to 6 weeks' worth of days. To extend it to
			an entire year wouldn't be impossible, but representing that data
			visually might be the challenge. I cannot at the moment justify cases
			where one might want to calculate, say, 4 months in the future, but 
			I can see how planning into the next 2 months makes sense. If you mostly
			have trips planned in the later half of month 1, and the earlier half of month 2,
			it makes sense to activate your pass only in the half of month 1 and have
			it carry over its duration to month 2.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you look into the source HTML, you will see that the table columns
			and rows are not dynamically generated; they are given IDs instead.
			(fortunately, I didn't type it all out myself, I used AI...)
			This is a very rudimentary approach, but scaling up might need me to 
			generate table rows using JavaScript. That is worth exploring.

		<h3>the usable update</h3>
		<time datetime="2024-09-10">2024-09-10</time>
		<p>
			The concession pass calculator is somewhat usable now, even without an API key!
			Just input the fare yourself. I will one day consider exposing the
			token so that this page can work perfectly fine as a static page.
			It should be fine because the key itself expires every 3 days (meaning
			there's no point storing it...), and 
			is rate-limited to 250 requests per minute. I should hope none of my 
			users are malicious!
		</p>
		<p>
			I will of course seek to improve the algorithm and user experience.
			Some refactoring is due, too. haha...
			But I'm happy to have come this far in such short time, even though
			everything was rather simple.
		</p>
		<p>
			A core functionality will be to calculate not just how much you spend in
			the next 30 days, but also to find the 30-day period where you spend the most,
			in essence, optimising your purchase to make the MOST value.
			Maybe also have a way to show how much you spend in any 30-day period anyway.

		<h3>feeling motivated</h3>
		<time datetime="2024-09-09">2024-09-09</time>
		<p>
			I'll let you know that my initial school project began back in late
			2023, and public transport fares were due for an increase in Dec '23.
			Now, we're here again, news broke that there'll be a big increase in
			fares by card only (concession passes are untouched again!).
		</p>
		<p>
			Ten whole cents per journey! That's roughly a 10% increase, if the 
			starting fare for a journey is $0.99. Wow... all the more I should
			seek to get this project done.

		<h3>calendar</h3>
		<time datetime="2024-09-07">2024-09-07</time>
		<p>
			I have created a simple calendar. You should be able to calculate
			your fares for the next 30 days. It is at this point where I really
			need to hit the drawing board on the user experience, and at the same
			time consider how difficult it is to implement it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The main sticking point is trying to create the UI for the calendar.
			It seems I may need to expand on it, if I want a more visual representation
			of trips and fares in a day/month. Golly...
		</p>

		<h3>the fare update</h3>
		<time datetime="2024-09-06">2024-09-06</time>
		<p>
			Using the OneMap API, I am able to, following the PROPER steps,
			retrieve public transport directions between two locations, also
			searched with the service.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am not particularly concerned about the directions itself,
			but at this stage how much they cost. So, I'm just taking the "fare"
			out of the first public transport route the API returns.
		</p>
		<p>
			We now move on to the calendar, because I believe the use case would
			be that most have regular commutes (school, work) that are relatively
			consistent. It also helps to visualise which days one is spending
			fare money on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ideally want the output to be "if you buy the concession pass
			starting on DAY (not necessarily today),
			you will get full value out of it for the next
			30<sup>1</sup> days". So, it is not necessary the calculator only starts
			counting from the current day. The UI will <i>definitely</i> take
			a long time to perfect.
		</p>
		<small>1 - Based on personal anecdotal information, I believe the duration 
		of the pass is not one month but rather 30 days. To confirm.</small>

		<h3>hello world!</h3>
		<time datetime="2024-09-05">2024-09-05</time>
		<p>
			I am re-starting from scratch my initial idea for a tool that
			assists with public transport related problems in Singapore,
			starting with a calculator to see if one should purchase a monthly
			concession pass.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have started using the 
			<a href="https://www.onemap.gov.sg/" target="_blank">OneMap API</a>,
			as previously I tried using GoThere but it seems to have some issues.
			This began as a UI/UX design school project for a mobile app, 
			but this time round I will focus on building a working prototype 
			before jumping into designing.
			More accurately, I have already done up some designs
			in the school project, so I should now take a step back and 
			explore implementation before narrowing my design down.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far, I am quite pleased with what OneMap offers. Some features
			are free to access without authorisation, but for the others,
			I will cross that bridge when I get to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, it's a calculator to tell you if you're spending more or less
			than $128 (as of this post) a month on transport.
