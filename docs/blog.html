			Using the OneMap API, I am able to, following the PROPER steps,
			retrieve public transport directions between two locations, also
			searched with the service.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am not particularly concerned about the directions itself,
			but at this stage how much they cost. So, I'm just taking the "fare"
			out of the first public transport route the API returns.
		</p>
		<p>
			We now move on to the calendar, because I believe the use case would
			be that most have regular commutes (school, work) that are relatively
			consistent. It also helps to visualise which days one is spending
			fare money on.
		</p>
		<p>
			I ideally want the output to be "if you buy the concession pass
			starting on DAY, you will get full value out of it for the next
			30<sup>1</sup> days". So, it is not necessary the calculator only starts
			counting from the current day. The UI will <i>definitely</i> take
			a long time to perfect.
		</p>
		<small>1 - Based on personal anecdotal information, I believe the duration 
		of the pass is not one month but rather 30 days. To confirm.</small>

			I am re-starting from scratch my initial idea for a tool that
			assists with public transport related problems in Singapore,
			starting with a calculator to see if one should purchase a monthly
			concession pass.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have started using the 
			<a href="https://www.onemap.gov.sg/" target="_blank">OneMap API</a>,
			as previously I tried using GoThere but it seems to have some issues.
			This began as a UI/UX design school project for a mobile app, 
			but this time round I will focus on building a working prototype 
			before jumping into designing.
			More accurately, I have already done up some designs
			in the school project, so I should now take a step back and 
			explore implementation before narrowing my design down.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far, I am quite pleased with what OneMap offers. Some features
			are free to access without authorisation, but for the others,
			I will cross that bridge when I get to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, it's a calculator to tell you if you're spending more or less
			than $128 (as of this post) a month on transport.
