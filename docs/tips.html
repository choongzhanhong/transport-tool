		<h3>morning pre-peak fares</h3>
		<p>
			If you board the train (tap in) before 7.45am, 
			up to $0.50 is deducted from the <b>train's portion</b> of
			the fare.
		</p>
		<p>
			That means if you start your journey with a train trip, the fare
			will be reduced by $0.50. This is a guaranteed because the minimum
			fare upon starting a trip is $1.09 (after fare increases).
			You will get the full discount, so it'll be $0.59.
		</p>
		<p>
			HOWEVER... if you start the trip with a BUS journey, the minimum
			starting fare will now be tied to the bus journey. If you take
			a transfer trip afterwards, the $0.50 will be deducted from the
			train's leg, however much it costs. If you travel far enough on the
			train, it could still be more than $0.50. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So, there are some scenarios where you might want to walk to the MRT
			instead of taking a bus there, to save a bit more money.
