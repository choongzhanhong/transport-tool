			I am re-starting from scratch my initial idea for a tool that
			assists with public transport related problems in Singapore,
			starting with a calculator to see if one should purchase a monthly
			concession pass.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have started using the <a href="https://www.onemap.gov.sg/">OneMap API</a>,
			as previously I tried using GoThere but it seems to have some issues.
			This began as a UI/UX design school project for a mobile app, 
			but this time round I will focus on building a working prototype 
			before jumping into designing.
			More accurately, I have already done up some designs
			in the school project, so I should now take a step back and 
			explore implementation before narrowing my design down.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far, I am quite pleased with what OneMap offers. Some features
			are free to access without authorisation, but for the others,
			I will cross that bridge when I get to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yes, it's a calculator to tell you if you're spending more or less
			than $128 (as of this post) a month on transport.
