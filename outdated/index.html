                    <h2>MRT Algorithm... Done?<time datetime="2023-11-24">24.11.2023</time></h2>
                    <p>
                        I first tasked myself with working out the algorithm
                        to determine the distance between public transport stops.
                        I got the bus stop data easily, but took some time to find
                        data on MRT stations. Specifically, I wanted the rail distance
                        between stations. This is different from the absolute georgraphic
                        distance between stations. 
                        Fares are calculated based on distance travelled, and I checked
                        that this was indeed the distance the train travels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I eventually found data on 
                        <a href="https://sgwiki.com/wiki/List_of_Distance_between_Stations" target="_blank">SGWiki</a>
                        formatted in a neat table, detailing the distance between
                        adjacent stations. That's perfect!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I parsed the data from the table into a csv,
                        then into a JSON, and finally put that JSON into a .js file.
                        Feel free to take a look at it in the GitHub repo.
                        This was because I had found some difficulty trying to fetch
                        the data, but if I load it as a js script it's perfectly fine,
                        especially since the data is static.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, for those who are learning beginner Data Structures and
                        Algorithms, this might be a textbook solution. I modeled each
                        pair of stations as an edge (e.g. Jurong East - Bukit Batok)
                        with its weight being the distance between stations. The graph
                        could then be read as such. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Afterwards, the shortest path between two points is found via Dijkstra's algorithm. I did this because that's apparently
                        how MRT fares are calculated. For example, if you're going from Jurong East to Raffles Place,
                        you could go via the East-West line or the North-South line. Since you only tap in and out at the
                        entry/exit stations respectively, there is no way to tell the route you took. So, the system
                        calculates the shortest path between the start and end (entry and exit gantries) to
                        determine the fare.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Yes, I used ChatGPT. I didn't quite want to re-write everything
                        from scratch. I think this is a neat application of AI to
                        speed up processes.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        I tested it against the 
                        <a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/map/fare-calculator.html" target="_blank">
                        LTA Fare Calculator</a> which seemed to be mostly correct. However, there were certain errors.
                        Some values differed when calculating, for example, the distance between Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang (4.4km)
                        Looking at the distance between adjacent stops in this path: Bukit Batok - Bukit Gombak (1.2km),
                        and Bukit Gombak - Choa Chu Kang (3.3km), one can find an addition error.
                        My algorithm gives 1.2km + 3.3km = 4.5km, which is expected.
                        I have yet to figure out a reason for the discrepancy, but I'm going to continue first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving on, I will try to create a function to calculate the distance for a bus trip (should be easier).
                        Then, a fare price calculator using the distances from these functions. I will also
                        have to create a front-end interface soon.
                        Side note, I should consider moving to a different blogging platform.

                    <h2>Starting Out<time datetime="2023-11-18">18.11.2023</time></h2>
                    <p>
                        This project started out as a Mobile Interaction design prototyping project
                        for university.
                        I do, however, plan to work on this as a real product.
                        I've done the "UX designer" portion. Now, I want to see if I can handle the
                        "UX engineer" part of the project. And then there's all the algorithms
                        I may need to employ, data sets I need to find.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of this blog post, the deadline for the school project is tomorrow. I'm
                        writing this as a break between my schoolwork.
                        I found some datasets online, but the MRT/LRT map, surprisingly, is lacking!
                        Particularly, there was no good data that I could find that accurately
                        reflected the distance travelled by trains between stations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, my first step to working on this tool is to do just that. Either find that dataset or do it myself (the latter is slowly becoming the option here). Well, there's only so many train stations, so I hope it won't take too long.
                    </p>
